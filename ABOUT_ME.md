## 📝 Philosophy

I believe in:

1. **Performance is non-negotiable** - Every millisecond matters for user experience
2. **Code clarity over cleverness** - Maintainable code wins long-term
3. **User-first design** - Technology serves people, not the other way around
4. **Continuous learning** - The web evolves, so do I
5. **Production-ready mindset** - Every line of code should be deployment-ready
6. **Global collaboration** - Timezone doesn't define capability
